# ECS-171-Project

## Setup and Requirements for front end
  Step 1: Download the folder 
  
  Step 2: `pip install ipywidgets` and `pip install voila`
  
  Step 3: open file name `UserInput_V2.ipynb`, read the instructions in the first commented box and Install the widgetsnbextension package in the         environment containing the Jupyter Notebook server
  
  Step 4: Open terminal and run `voila UserInput_V2.ipynb` where file is located, to start frontend server on local host as a .html web page.
